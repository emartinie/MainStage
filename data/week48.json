    "summary": "Learn the Bible in 52 weeks. This week's Bible study in a year is called judges. The commandment for the king to write a copy of the Pentateuch/ Torah demonstrates the work of Messiah. He Himself is the Word made flesh. He is the copy of the Torah in human form. Furthermore, He writes a copy of the Torah as He writes the Torah upon our hearts. The Torah of King Messiah is written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts (2 Corinthians 3:3).

    "instructions": "How it works: Read daily, listen to audio, and meet weekly in your HomeGroup."
