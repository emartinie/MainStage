    "summary": "The last reading from the book of Leviticus is called \"In My Statutes\", or Bechukotai (בחקותי). The name comes from the first verse of the reading, which begins with the words \"If you walk in My statutes …\" (Leviticus 26:3). This thirty-third reading of the \"Bible in a year\" promises blessings and rewards for Israel if they will keep the Instructions, but punishment and curses if they break the commandments of Instructions. The last chapter discusses laws pertaining to vows, valuations and tithes. Listen/ Read below:",
